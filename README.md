RandomWriter
============

Give an input text file and it will generate Random(obviously readable) Text for you!Stanford Assignment 2 CS106

Random writing is based on an idea advanced by Claude Shannon in 1948 and subsequently popularized by A.K. Dewdney in his Scientific American column in 1989. Shannon's famous paper
introduces the idea of a Markov model for English text. A Markov model is a statistical model that describes the future state of a system based on the current state and the conditional probabilities of
the possible transitions. Markov models have a wide variety of uses, including recognition systems for handwriting and speech, machine learning, bioinformatics, even Google's PageRank algorithm
has a Markov component to it. In the case of English text, the Markov model is used to describe the possibility of a particular character appearing given the sequence of characters seen so far. The
sequence of characters within a body of text is clearly not just a random rearrangement of letters and the Markov model provides a way to discover the underlying patterns and, in this case, to use 
those patterns to generate new text that fits the model.
